How do I code against one github repo on 2 computers

To keep both repositories in sync you should to pull the latest changes to your machine whenever you start working on the code.

To do this you want to execute

git pull

...which is usually set up to pull from the default remote (origin) to your current branch. Git might complain if this isn't the case, and so the longer version will work as well:

git pull origin {branch_name}

Note: this is the same process that you would use if two or more people were working on the same repo. Which is essentially what is happening, instead of two different people working on the same repository, you have two different machines working on the same repository.

If you are starting out fresh on a new machine all you need to do is clone the repo to it first:

git clone {remote_url}

You get this url from your GitHub repo's home page. This command will make a complete working copy of the repo in a subdirectory.
